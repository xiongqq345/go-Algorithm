//Recently, Devendra went to Goa with his friends. Devendra is well known for not following a budget.
//
//He had Rs. Z at the start of the trip and has already spent Rs. Y on the trip. There are three kinds of water sports one can enjoy, with prices Rs. A, B, and C. He wants to try each sport at least once.
//
//If he can try all of them at least once output YES, otherwise output NO.
//
//Input Format
//The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
//Each test case consists of a single line of input containing five space-separated integers Z,Y,A,B,C.
//Output Format
//For each test case, print a single line containing the answer to that test case â€” YES if Devendra can try each ride at least once, and NO otherwise.
//
//You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
